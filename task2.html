<h2 style="text-align:center;">MY VISION FOR INDIA</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">'My Vision for India’ is a speech delivered by India’s former President, Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, in which
he describes his three visions for India if it has to enter the comity of developed nations .He tries to make
people realise their duties and motivate them to build a stronger India.
First vision: He recalls how India has, time and again, been looted by invaders. India, on the other hand,
has never invaded any country because it respects the freedom of others. Modern India’s First War of
Independence was fought in 1857. Having subsequently achieved independence, we need to protect this
freedom, without which no one will respect us.
Second vision: India is growing economically and the rate of poverty is declining. The 10% GDP growth
rate is a healthy sign. But Dr. Kalam observed that Indians have failed to see themselves as a group of
self-reliant people. He, however, wants to see India as a developed and not just a developing nation.
Third vision: To see India strong, both economically and militarily, because people tend to respect those
who are strong.
Finally, India could become as great a nation as the United States of America or any European country
if its people stop criticising their own government and other institutions. A change in attitude is required.
Instead of complaining, people should participate in the process of development by resolving problems
on their own.</h2>
